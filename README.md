# Internship-Task-1
Everything about my internship work
I was assigned 10 tasks, the topics are as follows:-

1	Rock, Paper & Scissors Game	The Goal is to create a command-line game where a user is given a chance to choose between rock, paper, 
and scissors and if the user wins the score is added, and at the end when the user finishes the game the score is shown to the user.

2	Guess The Number Game	In this game, the task is to create a script that generates a random number between a range 
if the user guesses the number right in three chance then user wins otherwise user loss.

3	Automating Emails	The task is to write a python script using which you can send emails.

4	Alarm Clock	Our task is to write a python script that creates an alarm clock.

5	Audio Book	Write a python script that can be used to convert a pdf into an audiobook

6	Weather app	Write a python script that takes the city name and returns the weather information of that city using web scraping.

7	Face Detection	Write a python script that can detect faces in an image and save all the faces in a folder

8	Reminder App	Create a Reminder App that reminds you after a certain time to do something as a desktop notification.

9	Dice Rolling Simulator	The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice.
When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. (Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.)The program will 
print what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. 
For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

10	 Days Calculator	The premise of this application is relatively straightforward. You have to create a program that takes in two dates as the input: a start date and an end date
. Once the input is received, the program will proceed to calculate the number of days between those two dates and give the result to the user. You can take in the input dates
in the DD-MM-YYYY format and extract the relevant parameters from the aforementioned string. This program can prove to be a challenging task for beginners and is one of the 
highly recommended Python projects to clear up any fundamental doubts with regards to arrays and if-elif-else statements. The real problem-solving challenge comes in when you
have to account for the difference in days in different months and when a leap year comes in.

I have completed all the 10 tasks and uploaded the code and the files necessary
